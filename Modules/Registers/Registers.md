# Registers

The registers are just temporary "buckets" of information that can be used at will by the processor. They are as follows

- [A Register](./A_Register/A_Register.md)

- [B Register](.//B_Register/B_Register.md)

- [Instruction Register](./Instruction_Register/Instruction_Register.md)

- [Pointer Register](./Pointer_Register/Pointer_Register.md)
